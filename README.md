# Simple Logistics

_Simple Logistics is a mod for [Project Zomboid](https://store.steampowered.com/app/108600/Project_Zomboid/), that adds a balanced way to store and transport certain construction items in bulk. The mod is available on [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1461151473) or [GitHub](https://github.com/Bejasc/Zomboid.SimpleLogistics/releases/latest)._

See [planned additions](https://github.com/Bejasc/Zomboid.SimpleLogistics/projects).

### Description

This mod adds new items and recipes to make hauling loads of logs, planks, and metal sheets easier.
The functionality is the same as Hydrocraft, with slightly different values, and the ability to recycle the pallet.
This mod can be used in a playthrough where you'd like to haul these big loads, but not include the hydrocraft mod.

They currently do not appear in any distribution tables (so they can only be crafted for now).
I intend to update this in future.

### New Items/Recipes
Each added recipe has a 'Pack' and an 'Unpack' variant. Unpack will give you exactly the items used to create the packed version.
The packed versions will create a new item that weighs less than the same amount of its unpacked item.
This allows you to carry more of that item, while still in a 'balanced' way.
The balance comes from the items still having a reasonably high weight, as well as requiring rope and the new 'pallet' item.

**Create Pallet(Weight: 1.5)**
15 Nails, 6 Planks, Hammer

**Recycle Pallet (Gives 5x Nails and 3x Planks)**
Hammer, Saw

**Lumber Stack(Weight:7.5)**
10 Planks, 2 Rope

**Pallet of Lumber(Weight:15)**

**Pallet of Metal Sheets(Weight:15)**

*Having trouble finding rope?*
This mod uses a lot of rope, and rope can be hard to come by in the vanilla game.
Check out my SimpleRope mod for a fast, easy, and blanced way to create some.
